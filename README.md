A project to predict the outcome of NBA matches using Machine Learning. Read full report [here](/report/report.md)

## Data Description

Note that the columns with column names as Team1COLNAME and Team2COLNAME correspond to the same COLNAME description, and the two columns refer to the two teams playing that game. Also, note that the statistics were taken on a month-wise basis from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and the [official NBA Website](https://www.nba.com/stats/).
